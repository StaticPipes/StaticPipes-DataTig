# StaticPipes-DataTig

This is code that lets you use DataTig in the StaticPipes tool.

It is a temporary repository, as eventually this code will be merged into DataTig. 
For this reason, it is not on PyPi but must be installed directly from it's git repository.

If you are developing the actual tool, check it out from git, create a virtual 
environment and run `python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -e .[staticpipesdev]`
